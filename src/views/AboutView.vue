          Hello and welcome to the SSPE! My name is Stephen Skiles and this
          website is my Senior Project for my Bachelor's Degree in Software
          Engineering. This website was made with Vue, .NET, OpenAI, and
          PostgreSQL. The goal of this website was to serve the purpose of
          containing standardized exams for software developers so that they may
          be able to track their progress and to potentially use their scores to
          prove their knowledge level to future employers. This project has a
          LONG way to go before it serves the original purpose in mind but for
          now, this project has numerous AI powered exams that are split up into
          different categories and tiers since each category can be split into
          sub-categories. I am sure most know this but since AI can be
          unreliable and inaccurate, this website is really only meant to act as
          a learning tool as of right now. Thank you for checking out this
          project of mine!
